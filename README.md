animate-text-content.js
=======================

This JS micro-library allows you to animate the text content of elements in the DOM. For example, if you have `<div id='number'>298</div>` and you want 298 to count up to 426 over 2 seconds, you write `animateTextContent.betweenTwoValues('number', 298, 426, 2000);`.
